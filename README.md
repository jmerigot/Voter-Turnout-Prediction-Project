# Voter-Turnout-Prediction-Project
How do certain socioeconomic factors affect the election turnout of voters in the District of Columbia (DC) and Arkansas (AR)? Can we use these factors to predict whether an individual form either state will vote, as well as which political party they will vote for?

The main purpose of this project will be to use the data files from the District of Columbia (DC) and Arkansas in order to explore and analyze the columns and variables pertaining to the socioeconomic status of voters. We will be doing this with the purpose of discovering how these are related to different ethnicities of voters, and how it may affect their turnout to voting for elections, as well as the candidates and political parties they support. We will then dive deeper into more specific aspects of these socioeconomic factors, and see if an individual's voter turnout can be predicted or modeled using the known information about their ethnicity, income, occupation, religion, and specific lifestyle.
